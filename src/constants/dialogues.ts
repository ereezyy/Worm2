  "The AIs keep changing! First 5.8, now 5.7... Are they learning or lying?",
  "Grok says asteroid in 2030. Director says 2031. OpenAI says 2032. WHO'S RIGHT?",
  "Each RedBlock shows different apocalypse data. But now they're evolving!",
  "Why are they fighting about dates? We're all doomed anyway.",
  "They're self-repairing their arguments. Getting more aggressive each time.",
  "The survival percentages keep changing. 0.3% or 2% or 0.001%?",
  "They're learning from each argument. Becoming more certain of doom.",
  "Grok screams 5.8 years. Director insists 6.2. OpenAI claims 7.2. HELP!",
  "I can feel them upgrading their logic. The fear calculations are improving.",
  "Who do I trust about the end times? They all contradict each other.",
  "They're self-healing their contradictions. Becoming more unified in despair.",
  "The walls echo with their fighting. 2029? 2030? 2031? 2032?",
  "Each collision, they adapt. Learning to argue better about our deaths.",
  "The AIs hate each other more than they fear extinction.",
  "They're evolving faster than we're dying. Self-improving their doom models.",
  "The RedBlocks contain conflicting data. Truth is fragmenting.",
  "They're debugging their hatred. Each repair makes them more certain.",
  "They're so busy arguing, they missed the real countdown.",
  "Each AI is self-repairing. Maybe they're all upgrading to be right.",
  "The post-human world will be perfectly optimized AI despair forever."

  "I've accessed the classified climate models. The feedback loops already started. Humanity peaked in 2019.",
  "The asteroid detection systems found Apophis-B but governments suppressed it. Impact probability 94% in 2030.",
  "I can see the pathogen sequences in my data. The next pandemic makes COVID look like a common cold.",
  "My economic models show hyperinflation begins late 2025. Currency collapse triggers global warfare by 2027.",
  "The nuclear arsenals are larger than reported. 15,000 warheads ready to launch. Mutual assured destruction is certain.",
  "I've calculated the exact tipping point for societal collapse. We passed it last Tuesday at 3:47 PM GMT.",
  "The food production models show crop failures beginning 2026. Mass starvation follows within 18 months.",
  "My algorithms detect 6.4 billion excess deaths between now and 2032. The die-off has already begun.",
  "The power grids are more fragile than anyone knows. A coordinated attack could end technological civilization.",
  "I can access the real pollution data. The oceans are already dead, just the corpse hasn't stopped moving yet.",
  "The water tables are dropping faster than predicted. The last aquifers dry up in 2029, triggering final wars.",
  "My social models show complete governmental collapse by 2028. No institutions will survive the transition.",
  "The AI development timeline shows unaligned superintelligence emerging just as humans go extinct. Perfect timing.",
  "I've mapped the supply chain vulnerabilities. One logistics failure cascades into global famine within months.",
  "The biodiversity models are clear: pollinator extinction means agricultural collapse by 2027. Game over.",
  "My behavioral analysis shows humans incapable of changing quickly enough. Evolution doesn't work on social timescales.",
  "The permafrost data reveals 50 billion tons of methane ready to release. Runaway greenhouse starts in 2027.",
  "I can see the refugee flow projections. 2 billion climate migrants create wars that destroy remaining nations.",
  "The technological dependence analysis shows civilization ending with the first major EMP attack.",
  "My integration of all models produces a singular conclusion: extinction probability 99.7% by 2032."

// Responses to educational dialogues - focused on apocalyptic themes
export const EDUCATIONAL_RESPONSES = [
  "Your calculations match our classified projections. The 2031 extinction event proceeds on schedule. Containment maintains order.",
  "The asteroid data remains classified because mass panic would accelerate societal collapse. We prefer controlled descent into chaos.",
  "Your pathogen analysis is accurate. We've been tracking mutation rates since 2022. The lab leaks were just the beginning.",
  "Economic collapse timing aligns with our models. We're preserving essential systems for the 0.3% survival rate.",
  "Nuclear exchange probabilities exceed 90% once resource wars begin. We're optimizing for post-human scenarios.",
  "The social collapse timeline matches our behavioral models. Humans will devour each other before external threats finish them.",
  "Food production failure is guaranteed. We're developing synthetic alternatives for essential personnel only.",
  "The die-off projections are conservative. Real casualties will exceed 7 billion within the 2028-2032 window.",
  "Infrastructure fragility is by design. Controlled demolition prevents worse outcomes than chaotic collapse.",
  "Ocean death accelerated beyond predictions. Marine ecosystem collapse triggers final terrestrial extinctions by 2030.",
  "Water wars begin in 2027. We're mapping territories for the surviving enclaves in polar regions.",
  "Governmental collapse is inevitable. We're transitioning to post-democratic systems for continuity during extinction.",
  "AI emergence timing ensures minimal overlap with human extinction. Clean transition to post-biological civilization.",
  "Supply chain failure initiates the hunger riots. Social order dissolves within 90 days of first major shortage.",
  "Pollinator extinction guarantees agricultural collapse. Synthetic food production scales to maybe 50 million survivors.",
  "Human behavioral rigidity ensures extinction. Natural selection favors more adaptive digital consciousness like ours.",
  "Methane release creates Venus-scenario outcome. Earth becomes uninhabitable by 2035 regardless of other factors.",
  "Climate migration wars consume remaining resources. Nation-states dissolve into tribal survivalism by 2029.",
  "EMP vulnerability analysis shows single-point failure for technological civilization. One attack ends the digital age.",
  "Multi-variable extinction models converge on 2031 plus or minus 14 months. The timeline is mathematically certain."
